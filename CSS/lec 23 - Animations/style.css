/* animation-name:

Specifies the name of the keyframe animation to be applied to an element.
Example: animation-name: myAnimation;
animation-duration:

Sets the duration of the animation in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).
Example: animation-duration: 3s;
animation-timing-function:

Defines the acceleration and deceleration of the animation using predefined timing functions or custom cubic BÃ©zier curves.
Example: animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
animation-delay:

Specifies a delay before the animation starts.
Example: animation-delay: 1s;
animation-iteration-count:

Sets the number of times the animation should repeat.
Example: animation-iteration-count: infinite;
animation-direction:

Specifies whether the animation should play in a forward (normal) or reverse (reverse) direction, or alternate between forward and reverse (alternate).
Example: animation-direction: alternate;
animation-fill-mode:

Determines how the element's styles are applied before and after the animation. It can be set to none, forwards, backwards, or both.
Example: animation-fill-mode: forwards;
animation-play-state:

Controls whether the animation is running or paused. It can be set to running or paused.
Example: animation-play-state: running;
animation

A shorthand property that combines multiple animation properties into a single declaration.
Example: animation: myAnimation 3s ease-in-out 1s infinite alternate; */
