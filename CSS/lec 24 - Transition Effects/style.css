/* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) provides several transition effects that can be applied to elements on a webpage to create smooth and visually appealing animations during state changes. These effects are achieved by specifying the desired transition properties in CSS. Here are some common transition properties and their usage: */

/* transition-property	--  Specifies the name of the CSS property the transition effect is for */

/* The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:
ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function */


/* The transition-delay property  --  specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect. */

/* transition-duration --	Specifies how many seconds or milliseconds a transition effect takes to complete */
